## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing a Spotify dataset that contains various attributes related to tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It encompasses an end-to-end process, including the normalization of a denormalized dataset, executing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary objectives of the project are to enhance advanced SQL skills and derive valuable insights from the dataset.
